## How content gets edited

Non-technical team members (Social Media Coordinator, committee leads) update content through the **visual admin panel** at `/admin/`, not by touching code. It's backed by GitHub under the hood — every save there becomes a commit to `main`, which triggers an automatic Vercel deployment (usually live within ~60 seconds).

An internal step-by-step guide for using the admin panel has been shared directly with the IAEG Peru Social Media team; ask a repo administrator if you need a copy.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

Site will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

To test the Decap CMS admin panel locally against a local Git backend (instead of the live GitHub OAuth flow), see the commented `local_backend: true` option in `src/admin/config.yml`.

## Key Eleventy collections (defined in `.eleventy.js`)

- `committees` — every file in `src/committees/*.md`, used to show a live "Active Committees" count on the Home page.
- `partnersPage` — points at `src/partners.html`, used to show a live count of partner organizations on the Home page.
- `eventsPage` — points at `src/events.html`, used to automatically feature the next upcoming event on the Home page.

## Deployment

Every push to `main` is automatically built and deployed by Vercel. No manual deploy steps are needed.
